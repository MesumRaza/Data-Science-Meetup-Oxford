## Global cities

In this era of market transformation and rapid urbanisation, cities are fast becoming dominant drivers of global economic and business growth. Half of the worldâ€™s population lives in urban areas, producing more than 80% of global GDP. By 2030, six out of ten people will live in cities, with their share of global GDP rising to 90%. It is no longer enough to go to market by country, as sub-regional and city trends need to be taken into consideration for finding new markets or making location-based investment decisions.
